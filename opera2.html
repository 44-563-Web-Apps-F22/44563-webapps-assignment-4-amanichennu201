    RECIT—MABEL

    All is prepared, your gallant crew await you.
    My Frederic in tears?  It cannot be
    That lion-heart quails at the coming conflict?

 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> No, Mabel, no.
            A terrible disclosure
    Has just been made.
    Mabel, my dearly-loved one,
    I bound myself to serve the pirate captain
    Until I reached my one-and-twentieth birthday—
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>   But you are twenty-one?
 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>     I've just discovered
    That I was born in leap-year, and that birthday
    Will not be reached by me till nineteen forty!
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    Oh, horrible!  catastrophe appalling!
 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> And so, farewell!
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>         No, no!
               Ah, Frederic, hear me.

                  DUET—MABEL and FREDERIC
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    Stay, Fred'ric, stay!
         They have no legal claim,
         No shadow of a shame
         Will fall upon thy name.
    Stay, Frederic, stay!

 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> Nay, Mabel, nay!
         To-night I quit these walls,
         The thought my soul appalls,
         But when stern Duty calls,
    I must obey.

  <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    Stay, Fred'ric, stay!
 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>      Nay, Mabel, nay!
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    They have no claim—
  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>      But Duty's name.
         The thought my soul appalls,
         But when stern Duty calls,
 <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6    Stay, Fredric, stay!
 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>      I must obey.

                    BALLAD—MABEL

    Ah, leave me not to pine
         Alone and desolate;
    No fate seemed fair as mine,
         No happiness so great!
    And Nature, day by day,
         Has sung in accents clear
    This joyous roundelay,
         "He loves thee— he is here.
              Fa-la, la-la,
              Fa-la, la-la.
         He loves thee— he is here.
              Fa-la, la-la, Fa-la."

    <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> Ah, must I leave thee here
         In endless night to dream,
    Where joy is dark and drear,
         And sorrow all supreme—
    Where nature, day by day,
         Will sing, in altered tone,
    This weary roundelay,
         "He loves thee— he is gone.
              Fa-la, la-la,
              Fa-la, la-la.
         He loves thee— he is gone.
              Fa-la, la-la, Fa-la."

  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> In 1940 I of age shall be,
    I'll then return, and claim you—I declare it!
  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>              It seems so long!
 <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>    Swear that, till then, you will be true to me.
   <h6 class="MABEL"> MABEL:</h6>              Yes, I'll be strong!
    By all the Stanleys dead and gone, I swear it!

                      ENSEMBLE

    Oh, here is love, and here is truth,
         And here is food for joyous laughter:
    He (she) will be faithful to his (her) sooth
         Till we are wed, and even after.
              Oh, here is love, etc.

  <p>(FREDERIC rushes to window and leaps out)</p>

  <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    (almost fainting)  No, I am brave!  Oh, family descent,
    How great thy charm, thy sway how excellent!
    Come one and all, undaunted men in blue,
    A crisis, now, affairs are coming to!

 <p>(Enter POLICE, marching in single file)</p>

  <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>      Though in body and in mind
   <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                  Tarantara!  tarantara!
  <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>      We are timidly inclined,
   <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                  Tarantara!
  <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>      And anything but blind
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                  Tarantara!  tarantara!
  <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>     To the danger that's behind,
<h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                  Tarantara!
 <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>     Yet, when the danger's near,
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                 Tarantara! tarantara!
  <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>      We manage to appear
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                 Tarantara!
   <h6 class="SERGEANT">SERGEANT:</h6>      As insensible to fear
         As anybody here,
         As anybody here.
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>                  Tarantara! tarantara!, etc.

  <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    Sergeant, approach!  Young Frederic was to have led you
    to death and glory.
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>   That is not a pleasant way of putting it.
  <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    No matter; he will not so lead you, for he has allied
    himself once more with his old associates.
  <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>   He has acted shamefully!
   <h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>    You speak falsely.  You know nothing about it.
