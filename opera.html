     <h5>
        ACT 2 <br>
        Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.  Aisles C., R. and L.,
       divided by pillars and arches, ruined Gothic windows at
       back.  MAJOR-GENERAL STANLEY discovered seated R.C.
       pensively, surrounded by his daughters.<br>

    <pre>
        <p>(Enter MABEL)</p>

        SOLO—MABEL

  Dear father, why leave your bed
  At this untimely hour,
  When happy daylight is dead,
  And darksome dangers low'r?
  See, heav'n has lit her lamp,
  The midnight hour is past,
  And the chilly night-air is damp.
 <h6 class="FREDERICK">FREDERIC:</h6> Hush, hush!  not a word; I see a light inside!
                     The Major-Gen'ral comes, so quickly hide!
  <h6 class="PIRATES">PIRATES:</h6>  Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!

                        <p>(Exeunt KING, FREDERIC, SAMUEL, and RUTH)</p>  

 <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>         Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!
 <h6 class="GENERAL"> GENERAL:</h6>  <p>(entering in dressing-gown, carrying a light)</p>
                     Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!

                            SOLO—GENERAL

                 Tormented with the anguish dread
                      Of falsehood unatoned,
                 I lay upon my sleepless bed,
                      And tossed and turned and groaned.
                 The man who finds his conscience ache
                      No peace at all enjoys;
                 And as I lay in bed awake,
                      I thought I heard a noise.
 <h6 class="MEN"> MEN:</h6>     He thought he heard a noise—  ha! ha!
 <h6 class="GENERAL">GENERAL:</h6>             No, all is still
                      In dale, on hill;
                 My mind is set at ease—
                      So still the scene,
                      It must have been
                 The sighing of the breeze.

                           BALLAD—GENERAL
     
<p>
  <h6 class="GIRLS">GIRLS:</h6>    Now what is this, and what is that, and why does father
                    leave his rest
                     At such a time of night as this, so very incompletely
                     dressed?
                    Dear father is, and always was, the most methodical of
                    men!
                    It's his invariable rule to go to bed at half-past ten.
                    What strange occurrence can it be that calls dear
                    father from his rest
                    At such a time of night as this, so very incompletely
                    dressed?
 <h6 class="KING"> KING:</h6>     Forward, my men, and seize that General there!  His
                     life is over.  (They seize the GENERAL)
<h6 class="GIRLS">GIRLS:</h6>     The pirates!  the pirates!  Oh, despair!
 <h6 class="PIRATES">PIRATES:</h6>  (springing up)  Yes, we're the pirates, so despair!
<h6 class="GENERAL"> GENERAL:</h6>  Frederic here!  Oh, joy!  Oh. rapture!
                    Summon your men and effect their capture!
<h6 class="MABEL">MABEL:</h6>     Frederic, save us!
<h6 class="RUTH"> RUTH:</h6>     One moment!  let me tell you who they are.
                    They are no members of the common throng;
                    They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.
 <h6 class="ALL">ALL:</h6>      They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.
 <h6 class="GENERAL">GENERAL:</h6>  No Englishman unmoved that statement hears,
                    Because, with all our faults, we love our House of
                    Peers.                                 (All kneel)
                    I pray you, pardon me, ex-Pirate King!
                     Peers will be peers, and youth will have its fling.
                     Resume your ranks and legislative duties,
                     And take my daughters, all of whom are beauties.

      FINALE—MABEL, EDITH and ENSEMBLE
      ENSEMBLE

       Chorus of all but Police                  Chorus of Police

  Go and do your best endeavour,        Such expressions don't
  appear,
  And before all links we sever                    Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  We will say farewell for ever.        Calculated men to cheer,
       Go to glory and the grave!                  Tarantara!
  For your foes and fierce and          Who are going to their fate,
       ruthless,                                   Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  False, unmerciful, and                In a highly nervous state—
       truthless.                                  Tarantara!
  Young and tender, old and             We observe too great a
  stress,
       toothless,                                  Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  All in vain their mercy crave.        On the risks that on us
  press,
                                                   Tarantara!
                                        And of reference a lack,
                                                   Tarantara,
  tarantara!
                                        To our chance of coming back,
                                                   Tarantara!

 <h6 class="GENERAL"> GENERAL:</h6>  Away, away!
 <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>    <p>(without moving)</p> Yes, yes, we go.
  <h6 class="GENERAL">GENERAL:</h6>  These pirates slay.
 <h6 class="POLICE"> POLICE:</h6>             Tarantara!
 <h6 class="GENERAL">GENERAL:</h6>  Then do not stay.
 <h6 class="POLICE"> POLICE:</h6>             Tarantara!
 <h6 class="GENERAL"> GENERAL:</h6>  Then why this delay?
 <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>              All right, we go.
 <h6 class="ALL"> ALL:</h6>     Yes, forward on the foe!
                    Yes, forward on the foe!
 <h6 class="GENERAL">GENERAL:</h6>   Yes, but you don't go!
 <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>              We go, we go
 <h6 class="ALL">ALL:</h6>       Yes, forward on the foe!
                     Yes, forward on the foe!
 <h6 class="GENERAL"> GENERAL:</h6>  Yes, but you don't go!
 <h6 class="POLICE">POLICE:</h6>              We go, we go
 <h6 class="ALL"> ALL:</h6>      At last they go!
                    At last they really go!

            Now for the pirates' lair!  Oh, joy unbounded!
            Oh, sweet relief!  Oh, rapture unexampled!
            At last I may atone, in some slight measure,
            For the repeated acts of theft and pillage
            Which, at a sense of duty's stern dictation,
            I, circumstance's victim, have been guilty!

 <h6 class="ALL"> ALL:</h6>      Young Frederic!  <p>(Covering him with pistol)</p>
 <h6 class="FREDERIC"> FREDERIC:</h6>      Who calls?

  <h6 class="KING">KING:</h6>     Have mercy on us!  hear us, ere you slaughter!
  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> I do not think I ought to listen to you.
                     Yet, mercy should alloy our stern resentment,
                     And so I will be merciful—  say on!

                   TRIO—RUTH, KING, and FREDERIC

 <h6 class="RUTH"> RUTH:</h6>     When you had left our pirate fold,
                 We tried to raise our spirits faint,
                 According to our custom old,
                 With quips and quibbles quaint.
                 But all in vain the quips we heard,
                 We lay and sobbed upon the rocks,
                 Until to somebody occurred
                 A startling paradox.
  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6>           A paradox?
 <h6 class="KING">KING:</h6>     <p>(laughing)</p>      A paradox!
  <h6 class="RUTH">RUTH:</h6>     A most ingenious paradox!
                  We've quips and quibbles heard in flocks,
                  But none to beat this paradox!
                  A paradox, a paradox,
                  A most ingenious paradox!
                  Ha! ha! ha! ha!  Ha! ha! ha! ha!
  <h6 class="KING">KING:</h6>     We knew your taste for curious quips,
                 For cranks and contradictions queer;
                 And with the laughter on our lips,
                 We wished you there to hear.
                 We said, "If we could tell it him,
                 How Frederic would the joke enjoy!"
                 And so we've risked both life and limb
                 To tell it to our boy.
  <h6 class="FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h6> <p>(laughing)</p>  That paradox?  That paradox?
 <h6 class="KING and RUTH">KING and RUTH:</h6> <p>(laughing)</p>      That most ingenious paradox!
                                     We've quips and quibbles heard in flocks,
                                     But none to beat this paradox!
                                     A paradox, a paradox,
                                     A most ingenious paradox!

                             CHANT—KING

  For some ridiculous reason, to which, however, I've no desire to
       be disloyal,
  Some person in authority, I don't know who, very likely the
       Astronomer Royal,
  Has decided that, although for such a beastly month as February,
       twenty-eight days as a rule are plenty,
  One year in every four his days shall be reckoned as nine and-
       twenty.
